#+TITLE: Chapter 15: The Brace-Gatarek-Musiela Framework

This chapter looks at the Brace-Gatarek-Musiela (BGM) model, which
provides a framework for the consistent valuation of a range of
interest rate options.

* 15.1 BGM Volatility Surface

The risk-neutral distribution for $L_T$ (the libor forward rate for
period $[T, T + \alpha]$) under the forward numeraire $Z(t, T + \alpha)$
is given by:

$L_T|L_{tT} \sim \mathrm{lognormal}(\log L_{tT} - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2(T - t), \sigma^2(T - t))$

where $\sigma^2(T - t) = \int_t^T \sigma^2(u, T)du$

For fixed T, the function $\sigma(t, T), 0 \leq t \leq T$ represents
the instantaneous volatility from $t \to t + \Delta t$ of the forward
libor $L_{tT}$.

The surface $\{\sigma(t, T), 0 \leq t \leq T \leq \infty\}$ is known
as the *BGM volatility surface*, after the Brace-Gatarek-Musiela model,
which first explicitly described the evolution of libor rates in terms
of their individual volatilities.

* 15.2 Option Price Dependence on BGM Volatility Surface

The price of a caplet on $L_{T_i}[T_i, T_{i + 1}]$, where $T_{i + 1} =
T_i + \alpha$, depends on the volatilities $\{\sigma(t, T); T_i \leq T
\leq T_{j - 1}\}$

A $T_i$ by $T_j$ cap price depends on the volatilities in a trapezium

$\{\sigma(t, T); T_i \leq T \leq T_{j - 1}, 0 \leq t \leq T}$

The volatility, and thus the price, of a swaption depends on a rectangle of the volatility surface

$\{\sigma(t, T); 0 \leq t \leq T_0, T_0 \leq T \leq T_{n - 1}\}$

Volatility trading in practice involves understanding the dependences
of particular derivative products on the BGM volatility
surface. Different derivatives can have inter-related dependences,
which allow assessments of relative value.

A typical implementation of BGM often involves assuming a relatively
simple function for the correlation structure, then proposing
functional forms for $\sigma(t, T)$. A nonlinear calibration follows
to obtain the best parametric fit of $\sigma(t, T)$ to market option
prices. One can also perturb the smooth surface to obtain an exact
nonparametric fit to market prices.
