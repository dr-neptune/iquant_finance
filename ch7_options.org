#+TITLE: Chapter 7: Options

* 7.1 Option Definitions

A *European call option* with *strike* or *exercise price* $K$ and *exercise date* or *maturity* $T$ on an asset is the right -- but not the obligation -- to buy the assest for $K$ at time $T$. The execution of this right is termed the *exercise* of the option.

The payout $g(S_T) = \max{(S_T - K, 0)} = (S_T - K)^+$

A *European put option* is the right to sell the asset for $K$ at time $T$.

The payout of a put option at time $T$ is $\max{(K - S_T, 0)} = (K - S_T)^+$

A *straddle* is a call plus a put of the same strike and maturity, and has payout $|S_T - K|$.

- A *European* option allows exercise only at time $T$
  - these are common on forward-rate agreements, and known as caps and floors
- An *American* option allows exercise at any time $t \leq T$
  - these are common on stocks
- A *Bermudan* option allows exercise at a finite set of times $T_0, ..., T_n \leq T$
  - these are common on swaps, where they underlie mortgages and callable bonds

At time t, a call option with strike K at maturity T is said to be:

- *at-the-money* if $S_t = K$
- *in-the-money* if $S_t > K$
- *out-of-the-money* is $S_t < K$
