#+TITLE: Chapter 10: Continuous-time Limit and the Black-Scholes Formula

In this chapter, we develop a framework that allows us to appeal to
the central limit theorem and take the limit of the binomial tree as
step sizes become smaller.

* 10.1 Lognormal Limit

Define the *logarithmic return* as

$\lambda_n = \log{(\frac{S_n}{S_{n - 1}})}$

Let $S_T$ be the stock price at a fixed maturity $T$ and suppose there
are $N$ steps on the binomial tree of size $\Delta T$, with $T = N
\Delta T$.

Then $Y_T = \log{(\frac{S_T}{S_0})}$ and let
$E(Y_T) = \mu T$ and
$Var(Y_T) = \sigma^2 T$ for some $\mu, \sigma$

We will take limits under the constraint that the mean and variance of
$Y_T$ will stay fixed as we increase the number of time steps $N$.

Then (see the book to fill in the blanks)

$Y_T = \lambda_N + \lambda_{N + 1} + ... + \lambda_1$

where $\lambda_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu \Delta T, \sigma^2 \Delta T)$

Given $\lambda_i$ is a R.V. with only 2 possible values, we can write

$\log{S_{N \Delta T}} = \log{S_{(N - 1)\Delta T}} + \mu \Delta T + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta T} \xi$

where $\xi = \pm 1$ with probability 1/2.

Therefore

$\log S_T = \log S_0 + \mu T + \sigma \sqrt{T} \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \Sigma\limits_{i = 1}^N \xi_{i}$

Letting $N \to \infty$, the central limit theorem gives

$\log S_T = \log S_0 + \mu T + \sigma \sqrt{T}W$ where $W \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$

The term $\sigma$ is called the *volatility* of the stock.

We can alternatively write

$S_T = S_0 e^{\mu T + \sigma \sqrt{T}W}$

and we have

$E(S_T | S_0) = S_0 e^{\mu T + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 T}$

* 10.2 Risk-Neutral Limit

On the binomial tree with time steps of length $\Delta T$, the risk-neutral probability is given by

$p^* = \frac{r \Delta T - d}{u - d}$

where $r$ is the constant interest rate for the term of the step.

So for small $\Delta T$ we can taylor expand:

$1 + u = e^{\mu \Delta T + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta T}} = 1 + \mu \Delta T + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta T} + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \Delta T + O(\Delta T^{3/2})$

Similarly, we have

$1 + d = 1 + \mu \Delta T - \sigma \sqrt{\Delta T} + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \Delta T + O(\Delta T^{3/2})$

Then we can plug the above expressions into our risk-neutral probability and obtain

$p^* = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}(\frac{r - \mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}}{\sigma}) \sqrt{\Delta T} + O(\Delta T)$

Then we can use our risk-neutral probability $p^*$ as an input to our argument in the previous section.
Instead of moving up and down with p = 1/2, we have $\xi_i^* = +1$ with probability $p^*$ and $\xi_i^* = -1$ with probability $1 - p^*$

Following the same steps as the previous section, the book derives

$\log S_T = \log S_0 + (r - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2)T + \sigma \sqrt{T}W$ where $W \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$

That is, under risk-neutral probability, $S_T$ is lognormally distributed with

$E_*(\log S_T | S_0) = \log S_0 + (r - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)T$

$\mathrm{Var}_* (\log S_T | S_0) = \sigma^2 T$

The actual expectation $\mu$ does not appear in the risk-neutral distribution.

Note that the risk-neutral expectation for log $S_T$ differs from the expectation under the actual probabilities, but its volatility is the same.

Under the risk-neutral lognormal limit

$E_*(S_T | S_0) = S_0 e^{rT}$

The choice of current time $t$ (above set to be 0) is unimportant and we have the general result that

$\log S_T | S_t \sim \mathcal{N}(\log S_t + (r - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2)(T - t), \sigma^2 (T - t))$

* 10.3 Black-Scholes Formula

** Result: Black-Scholes Formula

$C_K(t, T) = S_t \Phi(d_1) - KZ(t, T) \Phi(d_2)$

where

$d_1 = \frac{\log{(\frac{S_t}{K})} + (r + 1/2 \sigma^2)(T - t)}{\sigma \sqrt{T - t}}$

and

$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T - t}$

In our exposition, the formula has a straight-forward interpretation
as the expected value of the option payout under the lognormal
risk-neutral distribution.

In practice the risk-neutral distribution has to be log-normal. We
will see in the next chapter that the Black-Scholes-Merton formula can
still be useful even when log-normality does not hold.

** 10.4 Properties of the Black-Scholes Formula

*** Result $S_t \to \infty$

As $S_t \to \infty$, $\Phi(d_1) \to 1$ and $\Phi(d_2) \to 1$, since $\log(\frac{S_t}{K}) \to \infty$.

Therefore, as $S_t \to \infty$,
$C_K(t, T) \to S_t - Ke^{-r(T - t)}$, the value of a forward contract

This makes sense, as $S_t \to \infty$ we are certain to exercise the
call option, and thus the option price tends to the value of being
long a forward contract.

*** Result $\sigma \to 0$

As $\sigma \to 0$, $d_1 \to \pm \infty$

$+ \infty$ if $\log(S_t/K) + r(T - t) > 0$
$- \infty$ if $\log(S_t/K) + r(T - t) < 0$

The same result holds for $d_2$.

Therefore,

$C_K(t, T) \to S_t - Ke^{-r(T - t)}$ if $S_t > Ke^{-r(T - t)}$ and 0 ow

As the volatility of the stock tends to 0, the stock price becomes
deterministic, equivalent to a holding of cash invested at rate
$r$. If the stock is in the money forward, then the call option
becomes equivalent to a long forward contract.

*** Result $\sigma \to 0$, $\Phi(d_1) \to 1$, $\Phi(d_2) \to 0$, thus $C_K(t, T) \to S_t$

*** Result (Straddle Price)

Using a Taylor series expansion for the normal cumulative distribution
function $\Phi(.)$, we find that the straddle price is approximated by:

$s_t \sigma \sqrt{T - t} \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}(1 - \frac{\sigma^2 (T - t)}{24})$ + higher order terms
