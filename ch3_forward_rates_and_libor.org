#+TITLE: Chapter 3: Forward Rates and LIBOR

We now apply our forward contract machinery to the case where the underlying asset is a zero coupon bond (ZCB). This construct leads naturally to the concept of forward rates

* 3.1 Forward Zero Coupon Bond Prices

For $T_1 \leq T_2$, consider a forward contract with maturity $T_1$ on a ZCB with maturity $T_2$. That is, the underlying security price is $Z(t, T_2)$, the price at $t$ of the $T_2$ maturity ZCB, rather than $S_t$.

Consider the forward price of this forward contract, denoted $F(t, T_1, T_2)$, the delivery price such that the forward contract has zero value at time $t$.

** Result

$F(t, T_1, T_2) = \frac{Z(t, T_2)}{Z(t, T_1)}$

* 3.2 Forward Interest Rates

The *forward rate* at current time $t$ for period $T_1$ to $T_2$, $t \leq T_1 \leq T_2$, is the rate agreed at $t$ at which one can borrow or lend money from $T_1$ to $T_2$.

In the case that rates are continuously compounded, the forward rate satisfies:

$f_{12} = \frac{r_2(T_2 - t) - r_1(T_1 - t)}{T_2 - T_1}$


a weighted average of zero rates.

Similarly, in the case that rates are annually compounded, we have

$(1 + r_1)^{T_1 - t}(1 + f_{12}^{(T_2 - T_1)}) = (1 + r_2)^{(T_2 - t)}$

Since

$Z(t, T_i) = \frac{1}{(1 + r_i)^{(T_i - t)}}$ for $i = 1, 2$, ...

we see that the forward ZCB price is related to the forward rate by

$F(t, T_1, T_2) = \frac{1}{(1 + f_{12})^{(T_2 - T_1)}}$

We have used a simplified notation here. In general, we have to incorporate the current time, the start date of the interest period, the end date of the interest period, plus the compounding frequency of the rate.

* 3.3 Libor

The rate at which banks borrow or lend to each other is called *libor*, an acronym for the Londen InterBank Offered Rate.
The vast majority of interest rate derivatives have payouts that are functions of libor rates, short-dated interest rates of fixed term.

On the current day $t$, libor rates for periods $\alpha = 1$ (12 month libor, often abbreviated 12mL), $\alpha = 0.5$ (6 month libor), $\alpha = 0.25$ (3 month libor), etc, are published.

We denote the libor rate at current time $t$ for period $[t, t + \alpha]$ by $L_t[t, t + \alpha]$.

In chapters 4 and 12 we see that libor is integral to the majority of interest rate derivatives.

* 3.4 Forward Rate Agreements and Forward Libor

A *forward rate agreement* (FRA) is a forward contract to exchange 2 cashflows. Specifically, the buyer of the FRA with maturity $T$ and delivery price or fixed rate $K$ agrees at $t \leq T$ to

- pay $\alpha K$

- receive $\alpha L_T[T, T + \alpha]$

at time $T + \alpha$

Thus, the payout of the FRA is $\alpha(L_T [T, T + \alpha] - K)$ at time $T + \alpha$

The *forward libor rate*, denoted by $L_t[T, T + \alpha]$, is the value of $K$ such that the FRA has zero value at time $t \leq T$.

** Result Forward Libor Rate

The forward libor rate is given by:

$L_t[T, T + \alpha] = \frac{Z(t, T) - Z(t, T + \alpha)}{\alpha Z(t, T + \alpha)}$

Setting $t = T$, we have

$Z(T, T + \alpha) = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha L[T, T + \alpha]}$

which links the ZCB price (or discount factor) to the interest rate for that period.

* 3.5 Valuing Floating and Fixed Cash Flows

By definition of forward libor, the value at $t$ of an agreement to receive the unknown floating libor payment $\alpha L_T[T, T + \alpha]$ at $T + \alpha$ equals the value at $t$ of receiving the known quantity $\alpha L_t[T, T + \alpha]$ at $T + \alpha$, which is

$\alpha L_t[T, T + \alpha]Z(t, T + \alpha) = Z(t, T) - Z(t, T + \alpha)$

the difference between two ZCB prices

We thus have established the result that receiving an unknown libor interest payment from $T$ to $T + \alpha$ on a unit of cash has the same value as receiving the unit of cash at $T$, then paying the unit back at $T + \alpha$. This is intuitively clear, as one can invest the unit of cash in a libor deposit, receiving the libor interest payment.

The result is interesting between we have shown that the value at $t$ or agreeing to receive the random quantity $L_T[T, T + \alpha]$ at time $T + \alpha$ is a deterministic function of the known quantities $Z(t, T)$ and $Z(t, T + \alpha)$. This value does not depend on any distributional assumptions about the forward libor rate (a random variable). This is a key characteristic of *forward contracts*.

Valuing a fixed cashflow is easy. We know that receiving a fixed payment of $K$ at time $T + \alpha$ has value at time $t$ equal to $KZ(t, T + \alpha)$.
