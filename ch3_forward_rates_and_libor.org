#+TITLE: Chapter 3: Forward Rates and LIBOR

We now apply our forward contract machinery to the case where the underlying asset is a zero coupon bond (ZCB). This construct leads naturally to the concept of forward rates

* 3.1 Forward Zero Coupon Bond Prices

For $T_1 \leq T_2$, consider a forward contract with maturity $T_1$ on a ZCB with maturity $T_2$. That is, the underlying security price is $Z(t, T_2)$, the price at $t$ of the $T_2$ maturity ZCB, rather than $S_t$.

Consider the forward price of this forward contract, denoted $F(t, T_1, T_2)$, the delivery price such that the forward contract has zero value at time $t$.

** Result

$F(t, T_1, T_2) = \frac{Z(t, T_2)}{Z(t, T_1)}$

* 3.2 Forward Interest Rates

The *forward rate* at current time $t$ for period $T_1$ to $T_2$, $t \leq T_1 \leq T_2$, is the rate agreed at $t$ at which one can borrow or lend money from $T_1$ to $T_2$.

In the case that rates are continuously compounded, the forward rate satisfies:

$f_{12} = \frac{r_2(T_2 - t) - r_1(T_1 - t)}{T_2 - T_1}$


a weighted average of zero rates.

Similarly, in the case that rates are annually compounded, we have

$(1 + r_1)^{T_1 - t}(1 + f_{12}^{(T_2 - T_1)}) = (1 + r_2)^{(T_2 - t)}$

Since

$Z(t, T_i) = \frac{1}{(1 + r_i)^{(T_i - t)}}$ for $i = 1, 2$, ...

we see that the forward ZCB price is related to the forward rate by

$F(t, T_1, T_2) = \frac{1}{(1 + f_{12})^{(T_2 - T_1)}}$

We have used a simplified notation here. In general, we have to incorporate the current time, the start date of the interest period, the end date of the interest period, plus the compounding frequency of the rate.

* 3.3 Libor

The rate at which banks borrow or lend to each other is called *libor*, an acronym for the Londen InterBank Offered Rate.
The vast majority of interest rate derivatives have payouts that are functions of libor rates, short-dated interest rates of fixed term.

On the current day $t$, libor rates for periods $\alpha = 1$ (12 month libor, often abbreviated 12mL), $\alpha = 0.5$ (6 month libor), $\alpha = 0.25$ (3 month libor), etc, are published.

We denote the libor rate at current time $t$ for period $[t, t + \alpha]$ by $L_t[t, t + \alpha]$.

In chapters 4 and 12 we see that libor is integral to the majority of interest rate derivatives.

* 3.4 Forward Rate Agreements and Forward Libor

A *forward rate agreement* (FRA) is a forward contract to exchange 2 cashflows. Specifically, the buyer of the FRA with maturity $T$ and delivery price or fixed rate $K$ agrees at $t \leq T$ to

- pay $\alpha K$

- receive $\alpha L_T[T, T + \alpha]$

at time $T + \alpha$

Thus, the payout of the FRA is $\alpha(L_T [T, T + \alpha] - K)$ at time $T + \alpha$
