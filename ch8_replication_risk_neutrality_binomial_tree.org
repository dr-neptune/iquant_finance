#+TITLE: Chapter 8: Replication and Risk-Neutrality on the Binomial Tree

We now develop the link between *replication arguments*, *no-arbitrage*,
and *risk-neutral probabilities*.

* 8.1 Hedging and Replication in the 2-State World

Constructing an argument in which we construct a portfolio of an
option and stock that has no risk to movements in the stock price is
called a *hedging argument*.

A complementary approach is to consider a *replication* argument.  In a
2-state world there must be a unique linear combination of the stock
and zero-coupon bond that agrees with the option value in both states
at time $T=1$.  That is, a portfolio of $\lambda$ stocks and $\mu$
ZCBs which matches the option payout at $T = 1$.

The hedging argument constructs a portfolio of stock and option that
is hedged to any movement in the stock price, that is, it uses the
option and stock to replicate the bond.  The replication argument
constructs a portfolio of stock and bond to replicate the option. We
could equally use a portfolio of option and bond to replicate the
stock.

There are 2 states of the world and thus any 2 linearly independent
assets will span a payout at $T=1$. If the option price is different
than the price given by the replication argument, then we can
construct an arbitrage portfolio.

More generally, for a derivative with payout $D(\omega_A)$ in state A
and $D(\omega_B)$ in state B, we can find the replicating portfolio by
solving the linear equations:

$\lambda S_1(\omega_A) + \mu = D(\omega_A)$
$\lambda S_1(\omega_B) + \mu = D(\omega_B)$

where $\lambda$ is the number of long stocks and $\mu$ is a number of ZCBs

* 8.2 Risk-Neutral Probabilities

Using the probability $p^*$, under which the present value of the
expected option payout is the only possible arbitrage-free option
price (found by the replication argument), the expected value of the
stock price is its forward price (and its expected return is the
interest rate $r$). The value of $p^*$ for which this holds is called
*risk-neutral probability*.

In this particular one-step two-state binomial tree, the only possible
arbitrage-free option price is the price given by *risk-neutral
pricing*, that is, where prices are discounted expectations of payouts
using the risk-neutral probability.

The terminology "risk-neutral probability" captures the fact that
these probabilities depend on the values the stock can take in 2
states of the world, but not on the actual probability (or risk) of
those states. Risk-neutral pricing holds for all the assets. The price
of /any/ contract is the discounted risk-neutral expectation of its
payout at $T = 1$.

* Summary of 8.1 + 8.2

The replication argument determines that only one price can be free of
arbitrage and that any other price is arbitrageable. Risk-neutral
pricing demonstrates that this replication price is indeed
arbitrage-free. Therefore, we have obtained a unique arbitrage-free
price

* 8.3 Multiple Time Steps

When dealing with multiple timesteps, you can work backwards.
For example, first calculate $C_{110, A}(1, 2)$ and $C_{110, B}(1, 2)$, then use those values as the output
to calculate the number of stocks $\lambda_0$ and ZCBs $\mu_0$ needed to go from $T = 0 \to T = 1$.

There is a much easier way when we know risk-neutral pricing and the probability of an up-move is 2/3
at each node. Then the results look just like stacking probabilities:

$C_{110}(0, 2) = Z(0, 2) E_*(S_2 - K)^+ = \frac{1}{(1.1)^2} (\frac{2}{3})^2 34$

* 8.4 General No-Arbitrage Condition

** Theorem

The binominal tree is arbitrage-free iff $d < r < u$

** Result

No arbitrage portfolios iff $d < r < u$ iff $0 < p^* < 1$

That is, for the binomial tree, the absence of arbitrage portfolios is
equivalent to the existence of a unique risk-neutral probability $p^*$
under which prices are discounted expected values of the payout at
maturity.

The replicating portfolio for a general derivative contract, with payout $\gamma$ in the down state and $\gamma + \beta$ in the up state, $\gamma, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$, is $\lambda$ stocks and $\mu$ ZCBs, where

$\lambda = \frac{\beta}{S_0 (u - d)}$

$\mu = \gamma - \frac{\beta (1 + d)}{u - d}$

The replication price can be expressed as *the discounted risk-neutral expectation*.

$\frac{1}{1 + r}(p^*(\gamma + \beta) + (1 - p^*)\gamma)$

When we have $n$ identical time steps, the risk-neutral probability distribution for $S_n$ is binomial with

$P^*(S_n = S_0(1 + u)^j(1 + d)^{n - j}) = \binom{n}{j}p^{*j}(1 - p^*)^{n - j}$ for $j = 0, ..., n$

For a derivative with payout $g(S_n)$ at time $n$, its price at time $T = 0$ is, therefore, given by

$\frac{1}{(1 + r)^n}E_*(g(S_n)) = \frac{1}{(1 + r)^n}\Sigma_{j=0}^n\binom{n}{j}p^{*j}(1 - p^*)^{n - j}g(S_0(1 + u)^j(1 + d)^{n - j})$

We can simplify this when it is a call option to obtain the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein formula
